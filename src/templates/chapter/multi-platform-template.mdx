# Multi-Platform Content Structure for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This template provides a structure for content that works across different platforms and implementations.

## Platform-Specific Sections

Use tabs or accordions to show differences between platforms:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ros2" label="ROS 2">

```python
# ROS 2 specific implementation
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="isaac" label="Isaac Sim">

```python
# Isaac Sim specific implementation
from omni.isaac.core import World
from omni.isaac.core.utils.stage import add_reference_to_stage
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gazebo" label="Gazebo">

```xml
<!-- Gazebo specific configurations -->
<sdf version="1.7">
  <model name="robot">
  </model>
</sdf>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Simulation vs Real Hardware

### Common Implementation

Start with common implementation that works in both simulation and reality:

```python
class RobotController:
    def __init__(self, use_simulation=True):
        self.use_simulation = use_simulation
        self.setup_robot()
    
    def setup_robot(self):
        if self.use_simulation:
            self.setup_simulation()
        else:
            self.setup_hardware()
```

### Platform-Specific Adjustments

Then note platform-specific changes:

<details>
<summary>Simulation Considerations</summary>

- Physics engine parameters
- Sensor noise simulation
- Rendering options
- Performance optimizations

</details>

<details>
<summary>Real Hardware Considerations</summary>

- Safety limits
- Hardware interfaces
- Calibration
- Physical constraints

</details>

## Hardware Agnostic Concepts

When describing concepts that apply to multiple platforms:

1. **Start with the principle**: Explain the concept generically first
2. **Show implementations**: Demonstrate how it applies to different platforms
3. **Note differences**: Highlight where platforms differ
4. **Best practices**: Recommend approaches for both simulation and hardware

## Module Coherence

Ensure consistent terminology and approach across:
- ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack integration
- Common interfaces between platforms
- Transfer learning between simulation and reality
- Shared components and tools
