## Glossary/Key Terms

### Physical AI & Robotics Terms

- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems that sense, think, and act in the physical world, integrating computational processes with physical form and environmental interaction.

- **Simulation-to-Reality Transfer (Sim2Real)**: The process of developing and testing AI/robotics algorithms in simulation environments before deploying them on real physical systems, including techniques to bridge the reality gap.

- **Physical AI**: A field focusing on AI systems that are designed from the ground up to interact with the physical world, considering the physics, embodiment, and real-world constraints from the beginning of the design process.

- **Humanoid Robotics**: The branch of robotics focused on creating robots with human-like characteristics, structure, and capabilities.

- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source robotics middleware that provides services like hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more for robotics applications.

### Platform-Specific Terms

- **Gazebo**: A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides realistic physics simulation and rendering capabilities.

- **Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's simulation application for robotics, built on the Omniverse platform, providing high-fidelity simulation for AI development.

- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing a robot model, including kinematic and dynamic properties, visual representation, and collision properties.

- **Nav2 (Navigation 2)**: The ROS 2 package for mobile robot navigation, providing path planning, obstacle avoidance, and localization capabilities.

- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A model architecture that combines visual perception, language understanding, and action generation for embodied AI systems.

### Technical Concepts

- **Perception Module**: A component of a robotic system responsible for processing sensor data to understand the environment.

- **Planning Module**: A component of a robotic system that determines future actions based on goals and environmental understanding.

- **Control Module**: A component of a robotic system that executes planned actions by sending commands to actuators.

- **Forward Kinematics**: The process of determining the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector based on its joint angles.

- **Inverse Kinematics**: The process of determining the joint angles needed to achieve a desired position and orientation of a robot's end-effector.

### Simulation Concepts

- **Domain Randomization**: A technique for improving the sim-to-real transfer of learning systems by varying the parameters of the simulation environment.

- **System Identification**: The process of determining mathematical models that best describe the behavior of a physical system based on measured input-output data.

- **Reality Gap**: The difference in performance between a robot control system when deployed in simulation versus in the real world.

### Safety & Standards

- **Safety-Rated Monitored Stop**: A safety function that stops robot motion with power maintained to the brakes, allowing for quick restart once the safety-rated input is removed.

- **Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI)**: Direct contact between a human and a robot during task execution, requiring careful safety considerations.

- **ISO 10218**: The safety standard for industrial robots, defining safety requirements for the robot itself and its integration in a work cell.

> **Note**: Terms should be defined with clear connections to Physical AI and embodied intelligence principles as required by the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution.
