# [Chapter Title]

## Introduction

<Tip>

This section should connect to the broader Physical AI theme and set expectations for what the reader will learn.

</Tip>

<Note>

**Embodied Intelligence Check**: Ensure this section explicitly connects theoretical concepts to physical embodiment and real-world robotics applications, aligning with the Physical AI constitution's emphasis on embodied intelligence principles.

## Simulation vs. Real-World

<Warning>

**Simulation-to-Reality Check**: This section must clearly demonstrate the progressive learning pathway from simulation to real-world implementation, following the Physical AI constitution's requirement for simulation-to-reality progressive learning approach.

</Warning>

## Compliance Check

This chapter template ensures compliance with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution:

- ✅ Embodied Intelligence First: All concepts connect to physical embodiment
- ✅ Simulation-to-Reality Progressive Learning: Clear pathways from simulation to real hardware
- ✅ Multi-Platform Technical Standards: Aligned with ROS 2, Gazebo, URDF, Isaac Sim, Nav2
- ✅ Modular & Maintainable Content: Self-contained and easily updated
- ✅ Academic Rigor with Practical Application: Theoretical concepts with hands-on examples
- ✅ Progressive Learning Structure: Follows required structure (Intro → Core → Deep Dive → Hands-On → Real-World → Summary → Key Terms)
- ✅ Inter-Module Coherence: Maintains consistent relationships between ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack

## Inter-Module Coherence

<Note>

**Inter-Module Coherence Check**: Ensure this chapter maintains consistent terminology, concepts, and implementation approaches with other modules in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, particularly regarding the ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack relationships.
