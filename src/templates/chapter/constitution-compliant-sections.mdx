# [Chapter Title]: Following Physical AI Constitution

## 1. Introduction - Relevance to Physical AI

Explain what this chapter covers and why it matters in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, focusing on embodied intelligence principles.

> **Note**: This section must clearly connect the theoretical concepts to physical embodiment and real-world robotics applications.

## 2. Core Concepts - Embodied Intelligence Focus

Break down all concepts with emphasis on how they apply to embodied systems that sense, think, and act in the physical world.

### Key Definitions

Define important terms with focus on their relevance to physical AI systems.

### Architecture & Components

Describe the architecture and key components relevant to this topic in Physical AI, considering how they would be implemented in an embodied system.

## 3. Technical Deep Dive - Simulation-to-Reality

Provide in-depth technical content with focus on:
- Architecture considerations for embodied systems
- Framework for connecting simulation to reality
- APIs for robot control and perception
- Pipelines for sensor data processing
- Mathematical grounding for physical interactions
- ROS 2/Gazebo/Isaac/VLA relevant structures
- Example code for robot implementations

```python
# Example: Robot control implementation
class RobotController:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize for physical robot or simulation
        pass
    
    def control_loop(self):
        # Implementation following Physical AI principles
        pass
```

## 4. Hands-On Walkthrough - Practical Application

Provide one guided practical activity focused on physical AI implementation.

### Prerequisites

List requirements for the hands-on activity with emphasis on tools/simulation environments.

### Steps

1. Setup simulation environment
2. Connect to robot platform (real or simulated)
3. Implement core functionality
4. Test in simulation
5. Validate for real-world deployment

## 5. Simulation or Real-World Example

Show how this chapter specifically contributes to building physical humanoid AI systems, with examples in both simulation and real-world contexts when applicable.
