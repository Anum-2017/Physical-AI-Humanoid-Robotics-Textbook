## Hands-On Walkthrough

Provide one guided practical activity for the learner that demonstrates the concepts in a physical AI context.

### Prerequisites

List requirements for the hands-on activity with emphasis on tools/simulation environments:

- **Software**: ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or Rolling Ridley), appropriate simulator (Gazebo, Isaac Sim)
- **Hardware**: [Specify if real robot needed, otherwise indicate simulation only]
- **Dependencies**: Required packages and libraries
- **Environment**: Properly configured development environment

### Setup Instructions

Detailed instructions to prepare the environment:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install ROS 2 packages
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup
   ```

2. **Download Resources**:
   ```bash
   # Clone required repositories
   git clone https://github.com/example/physical-ai-examples.git
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Set up environment variables
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   colcon build
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

### Activity Steps

Step-by-step implementation guide:

1. **Initialize the Robot System**
   ```bash
   # Launch the robot simulation
   ros2 launch example_bringup example_world.launch.py
   ```

2. **Implement Core Functionality**
   ```python
   # Example implementation
   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   
   class PhysicalAIExample(Node):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__('physical_ai_example')
           # Initialize your embodied AI implementation
   ```

3. **Test in Simulation**
   ```bash
   # Run your implementation
   ros2 run example_package example_node
   ```

4. **Validate Results**
   - Check for expected behaviors
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Verify safety constraints

### Simulation vs. Real-World Considerations

Explain differences between simulation and real-world:

- **Simulation**: Faster iteration, safe testing environment
- **Real-world**: Physical constraints, safety considerations, sensor noise
- **Transfer**: Considerations for moving from simulation to reality

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Issue 1**: Description and solution
- **Issue 2**: Description and solution
- **Issue 3**: Description and solution

### Extension Activities

For advanced learners:

- Enhance the implementation with additional features
- Apply to a different robot platform
- Experiment with different simulation environments

> **Note**: All hands-on activities should emphasize the physical embodiment aspect of AI, aligning with the Physical AI constitution's requirement for embodied intelligence principles.
