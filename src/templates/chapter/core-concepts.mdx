## Core Concepts

Break down all concepts in clear, structured sections with appropriate headings.

### Key Definitions

Define important terms related to this chapter's topic:

- **Term 1**: Definition focusing on its relevance to physical AI systems
- **Term 2**: Definition with embodied intelligence context
- **Term 3**: Definition connecting to real-world robotics applications

### Architecture & Components

Describe the architecture and key components relevant to this topic in Physical AI, considering how they would be implemented in an embodied system.

#### Component Breakdown

1. **Component 1**: Description and role in physical AI
2. **Component 2**: How it interacts with other components
3. **Component 3**: Physical embodiment considerations

### Theoretical Foundations

Provide the theoretical background necessary to understand the concepts:

- **Principle 1**: Explanation with physical AI context
- **Principle 2**: How it applies to embodied systems
- **Principle 3**: Connection to real-world implementation

### Relationships and Interactions

Explain how different concepts in this chapter relate to each other and work together in a physical AI system:

- How concepts connect
- Dependencies between components
- Integration considerations

> **Note**: All concepts should be explained with clear connections to physical embodiment, as required by the Physical AI constitution's emphasis on embodied intelligence principles.
