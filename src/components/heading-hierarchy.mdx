# Standardized Heading Hierarchy

This document defines the standardized heading hierarchy for all chapters in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Heading Structure

Every chapter should follow this consistent heading hierarchy:

### H1 (Main Chapter Title)
- Use only one H1 per chapter (the main title)
- This is automatically set by the MDX frontmatter title

### H2 (Required Sections)
Each chapter must contain these H2 sections in the specified order:

- `## Introduction`
- `## Core Concepts`
- `## Technical Deep Dive`
- `## Hands-On Walkthrough`
- `## Simulation vs. Real-World`
- `## Summary`
- `## Glossary/Key Terms`

### H3 (Subsections)
Use H3 for subsections within each required section:

```mdx
## Core Concepts

### Key Definitions
- Define important terms here

### Architecture & Components
- Describe system architecture
```

### H4 (Further Subdivision)
Use H4 for more granular content when needed:

```mdx
## Core Concepts

### Key Definitions

#### Sub-definitions
- More detailed definitions
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: All chapters must follow the same H2 structure
2. **Progression**: Maintain the order: Introduction → Core Concepts → Technical Deep Dive → Hands-On → Simulation vs. Real-World → Summary → Glossary
3. **Accessibility**: Use appropriate heading levels to maintain document outline structure
4. **Navigation**: Headings should enable effective navigation via Table of Contents
5. **Compliance**: Headings must align with Physical AI constitution requirements

## Physical AI Compliance

All headings and content must align with Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution requirements:

- Embodied Intelligence First
- Simulation-to-Reality Progressive Learning
- Multi-Platform Technical Standards (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, etc.)
- Academic Rigor with Practical Application
- Progressive Learning Structure
- Inter-Module Coherence (ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack)
