# Consistent Content Formatting

This document defines the consistent content formatting standards for all chapters in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Text Formatting Standards

### Paragraphs
- Use standard paragraph text without extra line breaks between paragraphs
- Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea or concept
- Use 1 empty line between paragraphs for clear separation

### Emphasis
- Use **bold** for important terms and key concepts
- Use *italics* for definitions and clarifications
- Avoid underlines (they look like links)

### Lists
Use ordered lists for sequential steps:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

Use unordered lists for non-sequential items:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Use nested lists when needed:

- Main item
  - Sub-item
    - Sub-sub-item
  - Another sub-item
- Another main item

### Code Blocks
Use proper language annotations for syntax highlighting:

```python title="example_robot_controller.py"
# Example of robot controller
def move_robot():
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

```bash title="installation.sh"
# Install ROS 2
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

### Mathematical Expressions
Use LaTeX notation for complex math:

Inline math: $F = ma$

Block math:
$$
\tau = I\alpha
$$

## Content Structure

### Progressive Learning Format
Each section should follow the progressive learning format:

1. **Concept Introduction**: What is this concept?
2. **Physical AI Connection**: How does this relate to Physical AI principles?
3. **Technical Explanation**: How does it work?
4. **Implementation Example**: Show with code or diagrams
5. **Simulation-to-Reality Consideration**: How does this work in simulation vs. reality?

### Code Example Format
Consistently format code examples with:

- Descriptive file titles
- Comments explaining the Physical AI principles being demonstrated
- References to ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, or VLA where applicable
- Error handling examples

## Visual Elements

### Images and Diagrams
Include images with descriptive alt text:

![Robot kinematics diagram showing joint angles](/img/kinematics-diagram.png)

For complex diagrams, provide both visual and textual explanations.

### Tables
Format tables consistently:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Mass | 10 kg | Robot mass |
| Height | 1.5 m | Robot height |

### Equations
Present equations with:
- Clear variable definitions
- Units where applicable
- Context for how the equation fits into Physical AI principles

## Technology Stack References

### ROS 2 Integration
When discussing ROS 2 concepts, consistently reference:

- ROS 2 distributions (e.g., Humble Hawksbill)
- Standard interfaces and message types
- Communication patterns (topics, services, actions)

### Simulation Frameworks
For simulation content, consistently reference:

- Gazebo simulation environment
- URDF/SDF model descriptions
- Sensor configurations and limitations

### Hardware Abstraction
When discussing physical hardware:

- Use consistent terminology for joints, links, and actuators
- Reference standard robot descriptions (URDF)
- Connect simulation concepts to real hardware limitations

## Accessibility Standards

1. Provide alternative text for all images
2. Use semantic headings (H1 through H6) in proper hierarchy
3. Ensure sufficient color contrast
4. Write alt text that describes the image's content and function
5. Use relative units (em, rem) rather than absolute units (px) where possible

## Physical AI Constitution Compliance

All content formatting must align with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution:

- **Embodied Intelligence First**: Always connect abstract concepts to physical implementation
- **Simulation-to-Reality Progressive Learning**: Structure content with clear progression from simulation to real-world application
- **Multi-Platform Technical Standards**: Consistently reference ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, Nav2, and VLA
- **Academic Rigor with Practical Application**: Balance theoretical concepts with hands-on examples
- **Progressive Learning Structure**: Follow the Intro → Core → Deep Dive → Hands-On → Real-World → Summary → Key Terms structure
- **Inter-Module Coherence**: Maintain consistent terminology and concepts across all modules

## Consistency Checklist

Before finalizing content, ensure it meets these formatting standards:

- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (H1 through H6)
- [ ] Consistent use of callout components (Note, Tip, Warning)
- [ ] Code examples with proper syntax highlighting and file titles
- [ ] Progressive learning structure followed
- [ ] Physical AI principles clearly connected
- [ ] Technology stack (ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA) consistently referenced
- [ ] Glossary terms linked using GlossaryLink component
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
