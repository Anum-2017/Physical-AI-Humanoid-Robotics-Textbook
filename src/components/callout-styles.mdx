# Consistent Callout Styles

This guide defines the consistent callout styles for notes, tips, and warnings across all chapters in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Note Callouts

Use for important information that supports the main content:

<Note>

**Embodied Intelligence Check**: Ensure this section explicitly connects theoretical concepts to physical embodiment and real-world robotics applications, aligning with the Physical AI constitution's emphasis on embodied intelligence principles.

```

## Tip Callouts

Use for helpful hints, best practices, or shortcuts:

<Tip>

This section should connect to the broader Physical AI theme and set expectations for what the reader will learn.

## Warning Callouts

Use for important warnings or critical information:

<Warning>

**Simulation-to-Reality Check**: This section must clearly demonstrate the progressive learning pathway from simulation to real-world implementation, following the Physical AI constitution's requirement for simulation-to-reality progressive learning approach.

## Detailed List Callouts

Use for detailed explanations:

<DetailedList>
- Component 1: Description
- Component 2: Description
- Component 3: Description
</DetailedList>

```mdx

```

## Tabbed Content

Use for showing different aspects of information:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="architecture" label="Architecture">
Architecture diagram or explanation
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="components" label="Components">
Component breakdown
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```mdx

</Tabs>
```

## Compliance Check Callouts

Include compliance checks where relevant:

---

## Compliance Check

This chapter template ensures compliance with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution:

- ✅ Embodied Intelligence First: All concepts connect to physical embodiment
- ✅ Simulation-to-Reality Progressive Learning: Clear pathways from simulation to real hardware
- ✅ Multi-Platform Technical Standards: Aligned with ROS 2, Gazebo, URDF, Isaac Sim, Nav2
- ✅ Modular & Maintainable Content: Self-contained and easily updated
- ✅ Academic Rigor with Practical Application: Theoretical concepts with hands-on examples
- ✅ Progressive Learning Structure: Follows required structure (Intro → Core → Deep Dive → Hands-On → Real-World → Summary → Key Terms)
- ✅ Inter-Module Coherence: Maintains consistent relationships between ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack

---

## Inter-Module Coherence Check

<Note>

**Inter-Module Coherence Check**: This chapter maintains consistent terminology, concepts, and implementation approaches with other modules in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, particularly regarding the ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack relationships.

</Note>

## Usage Guidelines

1. Always use these callout styles consistently across all chapters
2. Include relevant Physical AI compliance checks where appropriate
3. Use the progressive learning structure (Intro → Core → Deep Dive → Hands-On → Real-World → Summary → Key Terms)
4. Maintain consistency with the ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack terminology
5. Ensure all callouts follow the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution
