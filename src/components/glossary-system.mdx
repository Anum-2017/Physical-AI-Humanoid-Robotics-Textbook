# Glossary Linking System

This document describes the consistent glossary linking system for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook that ensures consistent terminology across all modules.

## Glossary Link Component

To link to glossary terms with tooltips, use the GlossaryLink component:

```mdx
import GlossaryLink from '@site/src/components/GlossaryLink';

This module focuses on <GlossaryLink term="Physical AI" />, which is grounded in physical reality.

The <GlossaryLink term="Embodied Intelligence" /> principles are crucial for understanding this concept.
```

This will render as:

This module focuses on <GlossaryLink term="Physical AI" />, which is grounded in physical reality.

The <GlossaryLink term="Embodied Intelligence" /> principles are crucial for understanding this concept.

## Supported Terms

The system currently supports these key Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics terms:

- <GlossaryLink term="Physical AI" />
- <GlossaryLink term="Embodied Intelligence" />
- <GlossaryLink term="Simulation-to-Reality Gap" />
- <GlossaryLink term="ROS 2" />
- <GlossaryLink term="Gazebo" />
- <GlossaryLink term="Isaac Sim" />
- <GlossaryLink term="VLA" />

## Custom Display Text

You can customize the display text while maintaining the glossary link:

```mdx
<GlossaryLink term="ROS 2">ROS</GlossaryLink> is the foundation for many robotics applications.
```

This will render as: <GlossaryLink term="ROS 2">ROS</GlossaryLink> is the foundation for many robotics applications.

## Adding New Terms

To add new terms to the glossary system, update the `glossaryTerms` object in `src/components/GlossaryLink.js` with the term name, definition, and link to the glossary entry.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use the GlossaryLink component consistently for all key terminology
2. Ensure all Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution terms are linked
3. Maintain consistency in how terms are referenced across modules
4. Include the ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack terminology in the glossary system
5. Use tooltips to provide quick definitions without leaving the page
6. Ensure links point to comprehensive definitions in the main glossary

## Integration with Physical AI Principles

All key Physical AI concepts should be linked to ensure consistency:

- <GlossaryLink term="Embodied Intelligence" /> principles
- <GlossaryLink term="Simulation-to-Reality Gap" /> considerations
- <GlossaryLink term="Physical AI" /> foundations
- Technology stack: <GlossaryLink term="ROS 2" />, <GlossaryLink term="Gazebo" />, <GlossaryLink term="Isaac Sim" />, <GlossaryLink term="VLA" />

This ensures consistent terminology and understanding across all modules in the textbook.
