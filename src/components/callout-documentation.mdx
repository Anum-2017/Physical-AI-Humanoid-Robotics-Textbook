# Consistent Callout Styles

This documentation defines the consistent callout styles for notes, tips, and warnings across all chapters in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Note Callouts

Use for important information that supports the main content:

```mdx
import Note from '@site/src/components/Note';

<Note>

**Embodied Intelligence Check**: Ensure this section explicitly connects theoretical concepts to physical embodiment and real-world robotics applications, aligning with the Physical AI constitution's emphasis on embodied intelligence principles.

</Note>
```

</Note>

## Tip Callouts

Use for helpful hints, best practices, or shortcuts:

```mdx
import Tip from '@site/src/components/Tip';

<Tip>

This section should connect to the broader Physical AI theme and set expectations for what the reader will learn.

</Tip>
```

## Warning Callouts

Use for important warnings or critical information:

```mdx
import Warning from '@site/src/components/Warning';

<Warning>

**Simulation-to-Reality Check**: This section must clearly demonstrate the progressive learning pathway from simulation to real-world implementation, following the Physical AI constitution's requirement for simulation-to-reality progressive learning approach.

</Warning>
```

</Warning>

## Detailed List Callouts

Use for detailed explanations:

```mdx
import DetailedList from '@site/src/components/DetailedList';

<DetailedList>
- Component 1: Description
- Component 2: Description
- Component 3: Description
</DetailedList>
```

<DetailedList>
- Component 1: Description
- Component 2: Description
- Component 3: Description
</DetailedList>

## Usage Guidelines

1. Always import the required component at the top of your MDX file
2. Use these callout styles consistently across all chapters
3. Include relevant Physical AI compliance checks where appropriate
4. Use the progressive learning structure (Intro → Core → Deep Dive → Hands-On → Real-World → Summary → Key Terms)
5. Maintain consistency with the ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack terminology
6. Ensure all callouts follow the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution
