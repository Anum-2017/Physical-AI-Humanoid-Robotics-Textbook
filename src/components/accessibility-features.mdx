# Accessibility Features

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook to ensure educational content is accessible to all learners.

## Accessibility Standards

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook follows these accessibility standards:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All content meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level AA standards
- **Section 508 Compliance**: Content meets US federal accessibility requirements
- **Educational Content Standards**: Special attention to accessibility needs of learners

## Implemented Features

### Semantic Structure

The textbook uses proper semantic HTML structure:

```mdx
# Main Chapter Title (H1)

## Section Title (H2)

### Subsection Title (H3)

#### Detailed Topic (H4)

Regular paragraph text with clear structure.

- List item with semantic meaning
- Another list item

1. Ordered list item
2. Another ordered item
```

### Color and Contrast

All content maintains sufficient color contrast (>4.5:1 for normal text, >3:1 for large text):

- Primary text: #222222 on #ffffff (contrast ratio: 17.6:1)
- Links: #2c7ae0 with hover state #1d56a8
- Note components: #4285f4 border with #f0f4ff background
- Tip components: #34a853 border with #e6f4ea background
- Warning components: #fbbc04 border with #fef7e0 background

### Alternative Text

All images include descriptive alternative text:

```mdx
![Diagram showing the ROS 2 node graph with publisher and subscriber connections](/img/ros2-node-graph.png)
```

### Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard:

- Links and buttons can be accessed with Tab key
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- Navigation components work with keyboard controls

### ARIA Labels

Interactive components use appropriate ARIA labels:

- Navigation elements have proper roles
- Interactive components have descriptive labels
- Complex components have appropriate descriptions

## Accessibility Components

### Accessibility Notice Component

Include accessibility information with the notice component:

```mdx
import AccessibilityNotice from '@site/src/components/AccessibilityNotice';

<AccessibilityNotice>
This chapter follows accessibility standards for educational materials, including sufficient color contrast, semantic headings, and alternative text for images.
</AccessibilityNotice>
```

<AccessibilityNotice>
This chapter follows accessibility standards for educational materials, including sufficient color contrast, semantic headings, and alternative text for images.
</AccessibilityNotice>

## Content Structure for Accessibility

### Headings Hierarchy

Follow a consistent heading hierarchy to enable screen readers to navigate content:

1. H1: Chapter title (only one per chapter)
2. H2: Major sections (Introduction, Core Concepts, etc.)
3. H3: Subsections within major sections
4. H4: Further subdivisions as needed

### Lists Organization

Organize information using proper list structures:

- Use `<ul>` for unordered lists
- Use `<ol>` for ordered, sequential steps
- Use nested lists for hierarchical information
- Maintain logical reading order

### Link Descriptions

Write link text that describes the destination:

- Good: "Read more about ROS 2 basics"
- Avoid: "Click here" or "Read more" without context

## Technology Stack Accessibility

### ROS 2 Content

When discussing ROS 2 concepts, ensure examples are accessible:

- Provide text descriptions of node graphs
- Use clear, descriptive names for topics and services
- Include alternative explanations for visual concepts

### Simulation Content

For simulation topics (Gazebo, Isaac Sim):

- Provide text descriptions of visual elements
- Explain visual indicators in text form
- Describe spatial relationships in words

### Code Examples

Code examples follow accessibility standards:

- Proper syntax highlighting
- Descriptive file names and titles
- Inline comments explaining Physical AI principles
- Clear, descriptive variable and function names

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

The textbook content is regularly tested with:

- axe-core accessibility testing
- W3C Markup Validation Service
- Link checking tools to ensure all resources are accessible

### Manual Testing

Content is manually tested with:

- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- High contrast mode
- Zoom functionality (up to 400%)

## Student Learning Accommodations

### Multi-Modal Content

Content is provided in multiple formats to support different learning needs:

- Text descriptions with visual elements
- Step-by-step instructions with visual guides
- Conceptual explanations with practical examples
- Theoretical concepts with hands-on activities

### Progress Tracking

Students can track their learning progress with:

- Clear learning objectives at the start of each section
- Summaries at the end of each section
- Self-assessment questions
- Practical exercises with solutions

## Compliance with Physical AI Constitution

Accessibility features support the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution by:

- Ensuring all students can access Physical AI principles regardless of ability
- Supporting the "Academic Rigor with Practical Application" requirement through multi-modal content
- Enabling the "Progressive Learning Structure" through clear semantic hierarchy
- Maintaining "Inter-Module Coherence" with consistent accessibility features across all modules
