# Consistent Cross-Referencing

This document defines the consistent approach to cross-referencing between modules in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Cross-Referencing Guidelines

### Internal Module References

Cross-reference to other modules using this format:

```mdx
For more information on [topic], see the [Module Name](/docs/module-path) module.

Example:
For more information on perception systems, see the [Sensors and Perception](/docs/sensors-perception) module.
```

### Figure and Table References

When referencing figures or tables from other modules:

```mdx
As shown in [Figure X](/docs/other-module#figure-anchor) in the [Module Name](/docs/other-module) module, ...

Example:
As shown in [Figure 3](/docs/manipulation#grasp-types) in the [Manipulation](/docs/manipulation) module, ...
```

### Code Example References

When referencing code examples from other modules:

```mdx
The implementation follows the approach described in the [Module Name](/docs/module-path) module's [Code Example](/docs/module-path#code-example-anchor) section.

Example:
The implementation follows the approach described in the [Locomotion](/docs/locomotion) module's [Walking Controller](/docs/locomotion#walking-controller) section.
```

## Cross-Module Consistency

### ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA Stack References

Consistently reference the technology stack across modules:

```mdx
This module builds on the [ROS 2](/docs/ros2-basics) foundation established in the [Robot Operating System](/docs/ros2-basics) module and integrates with the [Gazebo simulation](/docs/gazebo) environment as described in the [Simulation](/docs/gazebo) module.

It prepares for the [Isaac Sim integration](/docs/isaac-sim) covered in the [Advanced Simulation](/docs/isaac-sim) module and ultimately connects to the [VLA capabilities](/docs/vla-models) as detailed in the [Vision-Language-Action Models](/docs/vla-models) module.
```

### Physical AI Principles References

Continuously reinforce Physical AI principles through cross-references:

```mdx
This concept directly connects to the **Embodied Intelligence** principle discussed in the [Physical AI Foundations](/docs/foundations) module.
As detailed in the [Simulation-to-Reality](/docs/simulation-to-reality) module, implementing this approach requires careful consideration of the simulation-to-reality gap.
```

## Component for Cross-Module Linking

For frequently referenced cross-module connections, use this component pattern:

```mdx
import LinkCard from '@site/src/components/LinkCard';

<LinkCard 
  title="Related Module: [Module Name]" 
  description="Brief description of how this connects to the other module"
  link="/docs/module-path"
  linkText="Explore [Module Name] Module" 
/>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Contextual References**: Always provide context for why the cross-reference is relevant
2. **Constitution Alignment**: Ensure cross-references support Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics constitution principles
3. **Progressive Learning**: Structure cross-references to support learning progression
4. **Technology Stack Consistency**: Maintain consistency in how the ROS → Gazebo → Isaac → VLA stack is referenced
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure cross-references are accessible and add value to the learning experience
6. **Up-to-Date Links**: Verify that cross-reference links remain valid as the textbook evolves

## Example Implementation

```mdx
## Integration with Other Modules

The controller architecture described in this module builds upon the perception foundation established in the [Sensors and Perception](/docs/sensors-perception) module. As detailed in that module, effective control requires reliable sensory input.

For implementation details on the simulation environment used for testing these controllers, refer to the [Gazebo Simulation](/docs/gazebo) module. The simulation-to-reality transfer techniques discussed in the [Simulation-to-Reality](/docs/simulation-to-reality) module provide important context for understanding the limitations of simulated testing.

This module's approach to control integrates with the ROS 2 framework described in the [ROS 2 Basics](/docs/ros2-basics) module and connects to the [Isaac Sim](/docs/isaac-sim) environment covered in the advanced simulation module.
