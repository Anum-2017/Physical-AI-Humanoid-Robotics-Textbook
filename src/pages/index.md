## About This Book

This comprehensive textbook provides an in-depth exploration of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, connecting computational intelligence with physical embodiment. Our approach emphasizes the fundamental principles of embodied intelligence, simulation-to-reality progressive learning, and the integration of vision, language, and action in robotic systems.

Through this book, you'll learn how to build sophisticated AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world, with applications ranging from humanoid robots to autonomous manipulation systems.

## Our Four Core Modules

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules, each building upon the previous one to create a complete understanding of Physical AI:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the foundational elements of robot communication and control with ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and hardware integration.

<DocCardList items={[

    href: '/docs/module-1-robotic-nervous-system-ros2/01-understanding-ros2-as-the-robot-nervous-system',
  },
]} />

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Explore simulation environments and physics modeling that enable safe development and testing of robot behaviors before real-world deployment.

## Key Principles of Physical AI

Throughout this book, we emphasize several core principles that guide the development of embodied intelligence:

- **Embodied Intelligence First**: Connecting computational processes to physical embodiment and real-world interactions
- **Simulation-to-Reality Progressive Learning**: Building systems that can effectively transfer knowledge from simulation to reality
- **Multi-Platform Technical Standards**: Aligning with standard frameworks like ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, and Nav2
- **Academic Rigor with Practical Application**: Balancing theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation
- **Progressive Learning Structure**: Following a logical progression from basic concepts to advanced applications
- **Inter-Module Coherence**: Maintaining consistent relationships between different system components
