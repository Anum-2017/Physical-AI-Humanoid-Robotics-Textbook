# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### Embodied Intelligence First
Every AI system must be designed with physical embodiment in mind; Consider how algorithms will translate from simulation to real-world robotics; All AI components must be compatible with physical constraints and real-world sensorimotor integration.

### Simulation-to-Reality Progressive Learning
All concepts must start in simulation for safety and rapid iteration; Progress from simulation to real hardware following proven pathways; Include both virtual and physical validation in all testing.

### Multi-Platform Technical Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Content must align with robotics standards (ROS 2, Gazebo, URDF, Isaac Sim, Nav2, etc.); All implementations should be cross-platform compatible; Documentation must support both simulation and physical hardware.

### Modular & Maintainable Content
All chapters and modules must be self-contained, independently understandable, and easily maintainable; Clear purpose required for each section - no redundant or organizational-only content.

### Academic Rigor with Practical Application
Content must be technically accurate while remaining accessible to students; Every concept requires both theoretical explanation and hands-on application; Real-world use cases must accompany all theoretical discussions.

### Progressive Learning Structure
Content must follow structured progression: Introduction → Core Concepts → Technical Deep Dive → Hands-On Example → Real-World Connection → Summary → Key Terms; Each chapter builds on previous concepts in logical sequence.

## Technical Standards and Compliance
All content must maintain accuracy of robotics standards (ROS 2, Gazebo, URDF, Isaac Sim, Nav2, etc.); Content must stay aligned with physical AI, humanoid robotics, embodiment, control, simulation, and AI-robot integration; All generation must follow Spec-Driven Development principles.

## Content Structure Requirements
Each chapter must follow standardized structure: Introduction, Core Concepts, Technical Deep Dive, Hands-On Example or Mini-Tutorial, Real-World Connection, Summary, Key Terms; All content must support both simulation-first learning and real-world robotics transitions.

## Governance
This constitution applies to every module, every chapter, and every piece of content generated for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with embodied AI principles and technical standards; This constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation and approval.
