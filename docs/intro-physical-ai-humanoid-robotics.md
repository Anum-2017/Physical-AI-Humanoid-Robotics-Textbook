## What Is Physical AI? 🤖

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that do not exist only as software, but **perceive, decide, and act in the physical world**.  

Unlike traditional AI models that analyze data and return outputs, Physical AI systems:
- 🛰️ Sense the environment through sensors
- 🧠 Reason under real-world constraints
- ⚙️ Act using motors, joints, and mechanisms
- 📚 Learn from physical interaction

In short:

> **Physical AI = Intelligence + Body + Environment** 🌍

## What Are Humanoid Robots? 🤖🦾

**Humanoid robots** are robots with a body structure similar to humans, typically including:
- 👀 Head (vision, audio, cognition)
- 🏋️‍♂️ Torso (compute, power, balance)
- ✋ Arms (manipulation)
- 🦵 Legs (locomotion)

They are designed to:
- 🏠 Operate in human environments
- 🛠️ Use human tools
- 🤝 Collaborate safely with humans
- 🎓 Learn through physical interaction
